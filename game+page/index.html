                  <p>In 2019, humanity was on the verge of extinction. It is assumed that this was a virus. It is not known who created it and for what purpose. A few hours after infection, the man looked as if he had been starving for several months. After that, the man had to live for about an hour. From the continent were exported and saved only a few. But the virus was too tenacious. Outbreaks of the disease began to occur around the world, destroying whole cities. In just six months, half the world's population died out. After that, for some unknown reason, the virus stopped hitting people. By this moment of normal life, an end has come. Any big city was just killing dead. The governments ceased to exist, the armies were no more. But there was a new misfortune, the living dead - those people that died, infected with the virus, clearly wanted to eat. ...<br><br>
